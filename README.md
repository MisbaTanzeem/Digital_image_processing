1. Contrast Stretching
Description: Contrast stretching improves the contrast in an image by stretching the range of intensity levels.

2. Gray Level Slicing (Binary and Linear)
Description: This technique highlights a specific range of gray levels in the image, either through binary or linear slicing.

3. Bit Plane Slicing
Description: Bit plane slicing involves breaking an image into its individual binary planes (0-7).

4. Logarithmic Transformation
Description: Logarithmic transformation is useful for compressing the dynamic range of an image with large variations in intensity values.

5. Power Law Transformation
Description: Also known as gamma correction, this technique enhances image brightness or contrast depending on the gamma value.

6. Histogram Calculation
Description: This script calculates and displays the histogram of a grayscale image, which represents the intensity distribution.

7. Histogram Equalization
Description: This technique enhances the contrast of an image by redistributing the intensity values.

8. Image Subtraction
Description: Image subtraction highlights the differences between two images by subtracting pixel values.

9. Image Averaging
Description: Image averaging reduces noise by averaging the pixel values of multiple images.

10. Image Negative
Description: The negative of an image is produced by subtracting each pixel value from the maximum value (usually 255 for 8-bit images). This operation inverts the intensity values, creating a negative effect.
